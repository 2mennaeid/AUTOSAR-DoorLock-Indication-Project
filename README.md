## AUTOSAR Door Lock Indication Project

In this project, I developed a simple yet robust AUTOSAR-compliant system focusing on the Application Software Layer. The project simulates a door lock indication mechanism in a car, where an LED is used to indicate the state of the door. When the car door is opened, the LED turns on; when the door is closed, the LED turns off.

For this project, I used an STM32F103C8 microcontroller and built all the necessary drivers. I wrote the ARXML configurations for the Application Software Layer, ensuring compliance with AUTOSAR standards. I utilized a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) to synchronize the runnables within the software components, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.

The development process involved several tools:
- **Eclipse IDE**: For writing ARXML configurations for the AUTOSAR Application Software Layer.
- **ARTOP**: To generate the Runtime Environment (RTE) layer.
- **Keil IDE**: For debugging and simulating the code execution.

This project deepened my understanding of the AUTOSAR Application Layer, especially in the context of embedded systems development.
